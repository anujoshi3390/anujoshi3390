Algorithms I Have Experience With

I have worked with a wide range of machine learning, deep learning, and statistical algorithms, applying them to real-world datasets across marketing, healthcare, business analytics, and climate science. Below is a categorized list of the algorithms I have experience with:

🔹 Supervised Learning Algorithms
✔ Linear Regression – Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., sales forecasting, house prices) ✔ Logistic Regression – Binary classification problems (e.g., fraud detection, churn prediction) ✔ Decision Trees – Intuitive classification and regression models ✔ Random Forest – Ensemble learning for improved accuracy and stability ✔ Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) – High-performance predictive modeling ✔ Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Complex classification problems ✔ k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) – Instance-based learning for pattern recognition

🔹 Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
✔ K-Means Clustering – Customer segmentation, market analysis ✔ Hierarchical Clustering – Identifying natural groupings in data ✔ DBSCAN – Density-based clustering for anomaly detection ✔ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Dimensionality reduction for feature selection ✔ t-SNE & UMAP – High-dimensional data visualization

🔹 Time Series & Forecasting Models
✔ ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) – Time series forecasting ✔ SARIMA & Prophet – Seasonal time series forecasting ✔ LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) – Deep learning for sequential data

🔹 Deep Learning & Neural Networks
✔ Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) – Basic neural network architectures ✔ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – Image classification and feature extraction ✔ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – Sequential data analysis ✔ Transformers (BERT, GPT, T5) – Natural Language Processing (NLP) ✔ Autoencoders – Anomaly detection, feature engineering ✔ GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) – Synthetic data generation

🔹 Recommendation Systems
✔ Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based) – Personalized recommendations ✔ Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS) – Latent factor modeling ✔ Hybrid Recommendation Systems – Combining multiple techniques

🔹 Anomaly Detection & Optimization
✔ Isolation Forest – Detecting rare events and anomalies ✔ One-Class SVM – Outlier detection in high-dimensional data ✔ Genetic Algorithms – Optimization and search problems

I have applied these algorithms using Python (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, StatsModels,) and have optimized models for business intelligence, climate data science.
